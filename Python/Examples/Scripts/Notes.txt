You can run scripts directly from RoboDK by selecting:
Tools - Run Script 
(Shift+S)


The difference between the Python files (.py) available Scripts and Macros is that Scripts can be run without any modifications.

The Python files in the Macros folder is meant to be a pool of examples or files that you can add to your project for specific purposes.
