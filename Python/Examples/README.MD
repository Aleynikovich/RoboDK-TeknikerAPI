Examples
=========

This repository holds the RoboDK `Scripts` and `Macros` (examples). Some of these scripts are available in the install folder of RoboDK, see `RoboDK/Library/Scripts` and `RoboDK/Library/Macros`


Scripts
-----------

Any Python file (.py) in the `Scripts` folder can be run as a script within RoboDK.

To run a Python file as a script, select:

 1. `Tools`-`Run Script` (`Shift`+`S`)
 2. Select your script and select OK

Script files can be run for a specific purposes without having to make any changes to the code.


Macros
--------

Most PY files in the `Macros` folder are examples that may require adjustments to integrate with your projects. You can add these macros in your RoboDK station or run them in your Python environnement.
